# Erie Western Basin Analysis

### Python 3.10.16

## About
This repository provides a simple workspace for collecting data on the 
Lake Erie Western Basin from the National Data Bouy Center, using the
ndbc-api library and Jupyter Notebooks. Specifically, the Notebook aims 
to collect the water temperature data and conduct a simple time series 
analysis.

The project uses Python 3.10.16, since that is the latest version of 
Python for which the ndbc-api library has been tested.
